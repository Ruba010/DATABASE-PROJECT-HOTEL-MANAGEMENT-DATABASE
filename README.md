# DATABASE-PROJECT-HOTEL-MANAGEMENT-DATABASE

The system enables hotel employees to book rooms for customers while storing customer and employee data. Customers can also make purchases from the hotel's restaurant, with details of these transactions being recorded.

This is a Database Systems 1 Project, developed in collaboration with Shahad Hassan Altalhi, Wajen Naif Almatraf, and Mayas Adil Alakbary. We created an ER model, designed the database, and populated it with relevant data.

This project is an extension of the Database Fundamentals Project, where we implemented advanced features such as JOINs, subqueries, procedures, indexes, and other essential functionalities, all documented in the project file. Additionally, I worked on this project with Lama Salawati, Ruba Almalki, and Murooj Haddad.
